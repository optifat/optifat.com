          <p> Chess engine is pretty close to its final point. We need to implement
            some more rules, test these all and create evaluator. Hope by the end of
            2021 you will be able to play against it on <a class="link" href="https://lichess.org"> lichess.org</a></p>

          <p> Recently I've finally started creating backend for this website using Rust. It's a bit empty here right now,
              but there is a couple of ideas for further development</p>

          <p> One day I got tired of missing <a class="link" href="https://lichess.org/@/DrNykterstein">Magnus games on Lichess</a>
              because of minimized friend list, so I wrote small extension for Chrome to expand it after page loaded.
              It does nothing else right now, but there will be more features later (like session statistics).</p>
