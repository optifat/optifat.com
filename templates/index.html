      <p> Hi there! My name is Pavel Smelov. Optifat is a nickname I use back since about 2009. </br>
      I like programming, but I am too lazy for doing it regularly :) </br>
      I write on C++ and Python. I'm also studying Rust and Go, so I want to create some backend for this website using one of them as a practice. </br>
      You can find some of my code <a class="link" href="https://github.com/optifat">here</a>. Right now I'm trying to finish my own chess engine. Recently I've started creating text RPG/quest about space using Rust.
